Reveal all boxes that aren't bombs in order to win!
Numbers indicate how many of the adjacent boxes are bombs.<br>
Boxes adjacent to the box under your cursor are highlighted in blue.<br>


Controls:

Left click a grey box to reveal it<br>
Right click a grey box to mark a bomb<br>
When you left click a grey box and it turns out to be a bomb, the game doesn't end. Instead it keeps track of how many explosions you underwent. Bombs that exploded are marked with an asterix.<br>

You can't left click a red box<br>
Right click a red box to unmark it<br>

Left click a revealed box to perform a "shift-click" move: if the number in the box you clicked equals the number of marked bombs in adjacent boxes, all other adjacent boxes are revealed. Be careful, if you miss-marked a bomb, this means you will explode.<br>
Right click a revealed box to make it grey again<br>
