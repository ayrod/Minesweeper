Reveal all boxes that aren't bombs in order to win!
Numbers indicate how many of the adjacent boxes are bombs.
Boxes adjacent to the box under your cursor are highlighted in blue.


Controls:

Left click a grey box to reveal it
Right click a grey box to mark a bomb
When you left click a grey box and it turns out to be a bomb, the game doesn't end. Instead it keeps track of how many explosions you underwent. Bombs that exploded are marked with an asterix.

You can't left click a red box
Right click a red box to unmark it

Left click a revealed box to perform a "shift-click" move: if the number in the box you clicked equals the number of marked bombs in adjacent boxes, all other adjacent boxes are revealed. Be careful, if you miss-marked a bomb, this means you will explode.
Right click a revealed box to make it grey again
